# Hangman
Welcome to the easy hangman game where you will be asked to guess a random English word between 5 and 12 characters in length. As a player, you can make up to 8 mistakes while guessing the hidden word. If you make more than 8 mistakes, your fellow buddy will be hanged and the game will be over.

This game is designed to allow you to save your progress and reload it from where you left off.

So, have fun and try to save the poor guy! Good luck!

(Game is played entirely from the command line and is written in plain Ruby.)
